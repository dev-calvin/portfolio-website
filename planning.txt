  - About me
    -     '''
          Hi, my name is Calvin and I have had an interest in tech my whole
          life. When I was younger, I never imagined I would learn so much about how
          it works.

          My intro to web development started in high school at the coding West-MEC
          program in 2015. After this, I was sure it was something I wanted to pursue
          professionally. So, I continued to Arizona State University where I have now
          completed my Bachelors in Computer Science (Cyber Security).

          While at ASU, I have been programming professionally at XLR8
          Development honing my skills at web and mobile app development. I
          cannot wait to see where my degree and professional  experience will
          lead me to next. I am excited to learn new technologies and spread
          into new roles!

  - Experience
    - XLR8 Development LLC (2017-2021)
      - I have worked at XLR8 as a software developer part time for the last four
      years. This has been a super valuable experience where I was able to work
      on web and mobile apps for multiple businesses. I worked directly with
      clients to help them get a product they are happy with. In addition to
      development I also managed teams on a couple of the projects.
    - Qwaltec Internship (May - July 2021)
      - At Qwaltec I worked on a super interesting space craft project. My role
      was to help set up the user/tenant management for their system. This
      involved me setting up and learning everything involved in the sample
      Okta-DAC and the Okta BYOB-dashboard projects. In addition to user/tenant
      management topics I also learned and configured different Amazon Web Services
      that were involved with Terraform and Serverless. I also a developed a great
      understanding of the Oauth standard.
  - Education
    - West-MEC (2015 - 2017)
      - During high school I joined an interactive coding program prepared me
      for a career as a software developer. It taught me how to design and
      develop software, build apps for phones, tablets, websites, and write
      and test computer code. The program consisted of over a thousand hours
      overall.
    - Arizona State University - Computer Science (Cyber Security) (2017-2021)
      - At ASU I had a lot of time to practice the concepts I learned at West-Mec.
      In addition to strengthening the skills I already had I also learned a lot
      about other parts of the computer. I got lessons on each part of the computer
      from lower level topics like hardware logic, and assembly languages to higher
      level topics such as theoretical computer science, operating systems,
      algorithms, and cybersecurity.
